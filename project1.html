  Ooh, ooh
  Ooh, ooh
  Ooh, ooh
  To fall in love isn't easy when you're afraid of heights
  But, I can't help but fall when I look into your eyes
  So blue, I love the hue
  But more than that I do love you and
  Every night I'm in bed, I fight to keep you from my mind
  And almost every day that's how I spend most of my time
  It's true, there is no use
  I can't escape the thought of you, so
  Would you trust me to catch you at the bottom of the pool?
  If I told you my whole heart that I loved you, that
  I loved you that, I loved you
  But I'm afraid, I'm scared of those romantic words, you see?
  Ain't it ironic how those are just the songs I sing about?
  My lovely, do you rеally love me?
  When I hеar you whisper under your breath
  Ooh, ooh
  Ooh, ooh
  Ooh, ooh
  I lost you when I lost me, didn't mean to at the time
  All the hurt I was feeling in my heart it made me blind to you
  What you'd been through, I paid no mind
  Though I meant to and
  All the fire I felt within my bones became eclipsed
  Just the touch of your hands
  You're heart and oh my God, your lips
  Oh, I just wish that, I just wish that you would
  Would you trust me to catch you at the bottom of the pool?
  If I told you my whole heart that I loved you, that
  I loved you that, I loved you
  But I'm afraid, I'm scared of those romantic words, you see?
  Ain't it ironic how those are just the songs I sing about?
  My lovely, do you really love me?
  When I hear you whisper under your breath
  I love you
  I love you
  I love you
  Oh, it's true, oh
  Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
  Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
  Oh-oh-oh, ooh, ooh
  Ooh, ooh
  Would you trust me to catch you at the bottom of the pool?
  If I told you my whole heart, that I loved you, that
  I loved you that, I loved you
  But I'm afraid, I'm scared of those romantic words, you see?
  Ain't it ironic how those are just the songs I sing about?
  My lovely, do you really love me?
  When I hear you whisper under your breath</div>
